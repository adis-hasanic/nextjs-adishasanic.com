              <p>I'm a 24-year-old product designer from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Occasionally designed websites and various visuals used in marketing. Some experience with design systems recently.</p>
              <p>I'm self-taught, learned through 9 years of experience. In 2000s I played PC games a lot (CS, DotA, WoW), and in the Art & Design section of an online forum for gamers, I found Photoshop, installed it to see if it might be something for me, and after creating my first abstract image, I thought "This is it. This is what I want to do for a living." After posting my work of visual art, graphic design, logo design, and web design, on forums and showcase websites, I started getting freelance work when I was 14, and that led to UI and UX. Mostly worked remotely. On-site 1 year in San Francisco (Sep 2014 - Sep 2015) at Branded.me and Kamcord, and 1 year in Tallinn (Jan 2019 - Jan 2020) at Teamscope.</p>
              <p>I mostly rely on Figma and text editors on a MacBook Pro. Recently learned a bit about React, and made this site in Next JS. My process mostly comes down to asking questions and researching to better understand, making drafts (prototypes, mockups, wireframes) of what I think addresses the requirements, and discussing, iterating, testing, launching, and tracking.</p>
              <p>Currently freelancing based in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Soon joining <a href="https://gigapay.co">Gigapay</a> as a Product Designer and relocating to Stockholm. Feel free to reach out anytime at <a href="mailto:adishasanic96@gmail.com">adishasanic96@gmail.com</a></p>
