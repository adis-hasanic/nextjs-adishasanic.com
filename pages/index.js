After 4 months since I started, new version of Flowdash was posted on ProductHunt and it became #2 product of the month with more than 2000 upvotes.</p><br></br>

          <p>IndieCampers was a Lisbon-based early-stage startup, and biggest campervan rental service in Europe. I was given 1 week (in Oct 2018) to design UI and UX of a lengthy process of booking a campervan via mobile website. After total 8 hours of work, I turned 5 pages into 1, simplified steps and language, created a new visual style, and sent it via email along with my reasoning behind all the design decisions. CEO and PM were impressed and offered me a full-time role at IndieCampers.</p><br></br>

          <h2>Focus on writing.</h2><br></br>
          <p>Typen was a personal project. Frustrated by the lack of proper writing apps that make it easy to store text and customize the look without showing a bunch of toolbars during creative process, in 4 months (late 2016 - early 2017) I designed UI and UX of Typen, bootstrapped and recruited developer, and designed website and created Facebook ads. Within 2 months of launch, more than 2000 signups, and positive feedback on design sent by amateur novelists as well as a professional dramaturge. I learned a lot about process of launching a product and difficulties of finding the marketing message after the product has been built.</p><br></br>
