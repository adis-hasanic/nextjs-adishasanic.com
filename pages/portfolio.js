      <div className="text">Stacker is a startup with headquarters in London, backed by YC and Initialized Capital. Stacker is building a web platform that makes it easy to create custom business software without coding, based on connected data sources (Airtable, Google Sheets, etc.) I designed at Stacker on a freelance basis for 8 months total during 2020 and 2021, working mostly on UI/UX and design system. After lots of quick visual UI improvements, UX/UI redesigns, and new features, in second part of 2020 Stacker's sales skyrocketed, and in 2021 raised Series A from Andreessen Horowitz.</div>

      <div className="text">Teamscope was a Tallinn based startup (5-10 people) providing a web platform that helps companies reveal the underlying map of people’s characteristics (personality, values and competencies) to make better decisions in hiring, team building and employee onboarding.

I was at Teamscope full-time on-site in Estonia. Working closely with CEO and PM, I was designing product UI and UX, marketing website and created various visual and video assets for branding, marketing, sales, advertising and fundraising. Product was used by thousands of managers, employees and candidates in large companies, website redesigns increased avg. demo bookings from 5 to 30 per month, and Teamscope’s CEO, who was mostly selling the product to enterprise organizations, said that my work “made the product 10x of what it was and took the business to a whole new level”.</div>
