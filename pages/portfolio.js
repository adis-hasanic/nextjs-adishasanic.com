      <div className="text">My brother Dino, who writes code and manages a car dealership in California, hired me in 2019 to design an iOS app that makes it easy to find the right car and purchase it at a nearby dealership. The idea was that it should be like a social network, where options are narrowed by filters and reviews, and like a funnel that goes from exploration to making a list of favorites to contacting dealership to negotiate a deal. That's the customer side, and then there was also the dealership side of the app where vehicles are posted and leads tracked.</div>
